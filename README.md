# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
### Objective
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing.
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone
The goal is to prepare a tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

### Steps
1. Download the data for the project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
2. You'll need the reshape2 package
3. Save the run_analysis.R file in the parent folder of UCI HAR Dataset, then set it as your working directory.
4. Run source("run_analysis.R"). It will generate a new file tidy.txt in your working directory

You can read more about the data and the analysis in the code book.
